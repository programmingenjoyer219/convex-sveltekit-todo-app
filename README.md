## Convex Todo App (SvelteKit)

This project is a simple todo application built using [SvelteKit](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/), a typesafe backend-as-a-service (BaaS).

This app demonstrates how to implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a modularized way using Convex.

Refer to the official [Convex documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/home) for further details on features and functionalities.
